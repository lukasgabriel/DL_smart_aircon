# DL_smart_aircon
 
A reverse-engineering of a De'Longhi PAC N82 ECO Remote that allows users to control their Air Conditioner from their Smart Home System (i.e. Node-RED).

Based on https://github.com/zeroflow/ESPAircon and adapted to support newer versions of its dependencies and allow control from a local MQTT broker.

Hardware used in this example is a Node-MCU ESP8266.
